# Verve Frontend

**This is a proof of concept for a frontend mostly (JS/TS code) generated by LLMs (in this case Gemini 2.5 and 3 pro)**

The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/kschweiger/verve-backend).

## Setup

Build and run the frontend with [bun](https://bun.com/).

```bash
bun install
```

Run the dev server with

```bash
bun run dev
```
